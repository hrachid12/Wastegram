# Wasteagram

A mobile application that allows users to track daily food waste at their restaurants. A user can create a post by taking a picture or using a saved picture. The post is created with the photo, the number of leftover food items, the date the post was created, and the location of the device when the post is created. All previous posts are saved and are accessible by users. 

This application was created for Oregon State University's CS492 using Flutter and Dart and is hosted using Google's Firebase and Firestore.
